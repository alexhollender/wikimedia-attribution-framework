Wikimedia’s content is created by a global community of volunteers who share their knowledge freely. Every day, that free knowledge is surfaced in search engines, apps, AI assistants, media outlets, and countless other contexts. When the work of volunteers is reused, attribution is essential not only to providing proper credit and recognition to the people who make free knowledge possible, but also to ensure continued contribution and growth of that free knowledge.

Beyond credit, Wikimedia attribution guidelines are designed to foster trust. By highlighting signals such as reference counts, editor activity, or the latest update, reusers can make visible the processes that keep Wikimedia content current and reliable, strengthening their own credibility.

Attribution constitutes a key factor in the continued growth and sustainability of the free knowledge ecosystem. We have selected signals and interventions that not only enable audiences to find direct access and verify information at the source, but that can also help reusers light clear paths to engagement and contribution of knowledge.
